 - git add
 - git commit -am "comment"
 - git push

## AWS
My IP address is: 44.216.91.36

Launching my server I initially put it on a private subnet. Even though it had a public IP address and the security group was right, I wasn't able to connect to it. But now it's working fine.

## Caddy

No problems worked just like it said in the instructions! Suprisingly easy to get the website secured.

## HTML
[My site](https://startup.petranker.click). Things to know:

Use HTML tags such as \<header>, \<main>, and \<footer> to provide clear structural organization of the content

When using forms, it is important to utilize input types (email, password, etc) and label the input fields for accessibility

A static website will utilize an \<a> tag to handle navigation between pages

The \<img> tag is used to display an image, with appropriate alt text for accessibility

Tables are good for providing structured data to the user, like my leaderboard

HTML comments (\<!-- -->) are good to use as markers for place holders (api calls, db data, websockets)

Repeating layout components (like headers and navs) help provide a same user experience as users navigate through the app

## CSS
