## AWS
My IP address is: 44.216.91.36

Launching my server I initially put it on a private subnet. Even though it had a public IP address and the security group was right, I wasn't able to connect to it. But now it's working fine.

## Caddy

No problems worked just like it said in the [instruction](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/https/https.md).
