# Pet Ranker!

[My Notes](notes.md)

Pet Ranker is a website that allows users to view and vote on a list of different pets. Each day you'll have a few votes and can check the leaderboard to see which one is the favorite.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

People love their pets. But when it comes to deciding who's pet is the cutest, we can't agree. Pet Ranker will be a multi-user web application that allows peers to view and vote on many different pets, with a scoreboard for some friendly competition to show which one is the most "loved". Choose your favorites and vote for them each day!
