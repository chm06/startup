# Pet Ranker!

[My Notes](notes.md)

Pet Ranker is a website that allows users to view and vote on a list of different pets. Each day you'll have a few votes and can check the leaderboard to see which one is the favorite.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

People love their pets. But when it comes to deciding who's pet is the cutest, we can't agree. Pet Ranker will be a multi-user web application that allows peers to view and vote on many different pets, with a scoreboard for some friendly competition to show which one is the most "loved". Choose your favorites and vote for them each day!

- Add your personal favorites to your list
- View weekly scoreboard of all the pets
- Receive notifications if one of your favorites is doing well

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - I'll have three pages for: register/login, play (with options to filter by pet type), and leaderboard
- **CSS** - A pleasing and "friendly" color scheme with matching font, effects for when you hover over and click buttons like "love" and "favorite"
- **React** - Updates the UI dynamically, like switching between logged-in and logged-out views or updating parts when votes are cast
- **Service** - Use a pet-related API (like Petfinder?) to *fetch* pet images/profiles
- **DB/Login** - Saves user data (email, password, and favorites), restricts voting to signed-in users
- **WebSocket** - Sends and receives updates to the scoreboard in real time
